      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <h5>Kevin | NC USA</h5>
      <p>My stay here was very pleasing and welcoming from start to finish, the staff was superb and experts in the field and above all  helpful. The decor of the Inn itself was very modern yet old fashion, very vintage and retro. It had a very cool vibe during my stay in London. Which by the way was conveniently down the block from Big Ben! Great trip!</p>

      <h5>Angela | CA USA</h5>
      <p>I absolutely loved this hotel during my stay in Stockholm! The staff was awesome and helpful from start to finish. I loved the location being centered directly in the heart of the city with lots to do everyday. Pricing was very affordable but worth every penny during my entire trip. I was very pleased with my experience in visiting Stockholm and my stay in Nightingale Inn. I know for sure I will definitely be staying with these kind folks again.</p>
